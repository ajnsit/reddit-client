=============

A pure javascript reddit client written using the AngularJS framework.

It was purely meant to be a learning exercise, to evaluate the suitability of
AngularJS in javascript projects.

RUNNING

Requires NodeJS. Execute {project}/scripts/web-server.js from the project directory.

Running the files directly from file:// urls does not work due to cross site restrictions.
